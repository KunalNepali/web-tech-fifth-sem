    <h1>WHAT REALLY is this life for?</h1>
    <h2>FEELINGS ARE VOLATILE in nature.</h2>
    <h3>Time flies, people change.</h3>
    <h4>Hmm. it's just a part of life.</h4>
    <h5>Sleep, eat, repeat.</h5>

    <p class="indent">I was at bed early the other night. It was fun until I realized i could not sleep.</p>
    <p class="trans">I opened my window, let some air flow through my room. Then I could sleep later on.</p>
    <p class="space">The dream was something like my happening life. Someone was sick, I was sad, could not cry, could not express and I woke up at the morning as i was about to express myself.</p>
